# First Try React

This is a first try with React. It was created with create-react-app and has not been deployed as it was used as a learning tool. 

If you would like to see the app and what aspects I was practicing on a small scale, clone the repo to your machine and then

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

It should open in its own window and you can view what I created when I was first learning React. 

For a more complex app, please view MedMYnder in my repo.
